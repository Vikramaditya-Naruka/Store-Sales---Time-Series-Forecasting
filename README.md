Goal:
To predict the future sales for different stores and product families using historical data. The task involves using machine learning techniques, particularly time-series forecasting, to make accurate predictions that can help stores optimize inventory management, resource allocation, and overall sales strategy.

Workflow for the Solution:

Data Preparation:
 Use historical data from multiple stores and product families, including sales information, promotions, and other features like oil prices and holidays.

Feature Engineering:
 Generate relevant features like lag variables, rolling windows for sales trends, promotions, and external factors.

Model Training:
 Use machine learning models such as XGBoost to capture complex patterns in the data. Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV to improve performance.

Performance Evaluation:
 Validate the model using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, which penalizes larger errors more than smaller ones, making it suitable for forecasting tasks.
